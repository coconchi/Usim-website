#### Start and stop Apache on macOS

#para iniciar apache

	$ sudo apachectl start

# to check the server-s working, open a browser and go to localhost 
	$ sudo apachectl stop
	$ sudo apachectl restart

# to check what version of Apache is running on computer:
	$ httpd -v

# to edit configurations in Apache:
	$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

# to run a configuration test
	$ sudo apachectl configtest  <-- this command reads the configuration file and if 									 there is any problem, it reports it
	
# this directory contatins the default apache test files
	$ cd /Library/WebServer/Documents

# Usually, web resources are stored in /Library/WebServer/Documents
# We need to change permissions to write and read for everyone (cmd + I)	




#### Configue personal sites folders

# A personal website folder is subfolder of your home folder
# En ~ crear un folder que se llame Sites, i.e., ~/Sites <-- the OS recognizes this as a 
# reserved directory name

# Uncomment 
# ---- LoadModule userdir_module libexec/apache2/mod_userdir.so 
# ---- Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf
# with:
	$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

# Uncomment
# ---- Include /private/etc/apache2/users/*.conf
# with:
	$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf

# In
	$ cd /etc/apache2/users
# If the next file doesnt exist, then type:
 	$ sudo nano alejandro.conf
 	# This file should look like:	

	 	<Directory "/Users/alejandro/Sites/">
	        Options Indexes MultiViews
	        AllowOverride None
	        Require all granted
		</Directory>

	# If it doesnt, change it 



#### ACTIVATE PHP IN MAC OS
# Once again, we need to edit Apache-s main configuration file with
	$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

	# In the file, add the next line if it doesn-t exist
	AddHandler php5-script php  
	# this means that files that have php in their name will be handled with php

	# Uncomment the next line:
	LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so
	# Notice that we do not use php7 because we have php5 installed in macOS

# Now we need to create a php configuration file
# In:
	$ cd /private/etc/
	$ ls php* <-- to see al files that star with php
	$ sudo cp php.ini.default php.ini <-- to copy the file named php.ini.default into php.ini

	# Then we-ll edit this file we created with
		$ sudo nano php.ini
		# In this editor..
		display_errors=On (if it is set to Off)

# To test php is working, place a .php file in Sites folder
# Then start apache with:
	$ sudo apachectl start
# Then go to the browser and type:
	localhost/~alejandro/filename.php with the name of the .php file


#### INSTALL MySQL IN MAC OS 
# Download the MySQL community edition fron MySQL website
# Download MySQL workbench

# After installation, a new dialogue will appear in OS System Preferences
# System Preferences > MySQL <-- The MySQL server can be started and stopped here

# Install MySQL Workbench <–– MySQL workbench is the GUI of MySQL
	# Double click to open the server



# If you need to use a different MAMP stack, you will need to stop the Apache server
# When this server is stopped, you can use another version os Apache

# Uninstalling MySQL is a little bit more complex
# Stop server: System Preferences > MySQL > stop server (in case it-s started)
	# You should also make sure you are not running a MySQL workbench
	# Once the server is stopped, type the following commands in terminal:
	# (Before we type these commands,it is necessary to authenticate ourselves as
	# superusers: $ sudo . )
		$ sudo rm /usr/local/mysql
		$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/mysql*
		$ sudo rm -rf /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM
		$ sudo rm -rf /Library/PreferencePanes/My*
		$ sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/mysql*
		$ sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/MySQL*
		$ sudo rm /etc/my.cnf

# To uninstall MySQL Workbench go to apps, right-click in Workbenck and move to trash.
# Then empty your trash


#### GET STARTED WITH MAMP ON MAC OS 
# The MAMP software bundle is onw of the easiest ways to get started with Apache, PHP and MySQL on ma OS

# From the MAMP web page, download the installer
# Place the app in the apps
# Go to the MAMP app 
# From the MAMP app, we can go to the MAMP site. In tools > phpMyAdmin, we can find php management



#### Configure Apache and MySQL server ports
# In the MAMP app, all of the options are available under Preferences:
	# start/stop
	# ports
	# PHP
	# WebServer
	# MySQL


#### Uninstall MAMP
# Open application and make sure all servers are stopped
# In app directory, 


#### COMMON TASKS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
#### Diagnose port conflict on macOS
# Port conflicts can arise when we install more than one version of a server
 	$ sudo lsof -n -i4TCP:80 -sTCP:LISTEN  <-- lsof means list open files. The number after the colon is 							  the port we want to examine
